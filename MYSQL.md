# Setup

## Required Gemini CLI Version

To install this extension, the Gemini CLI version must be v0.6.0 or above. The version can be found by running: `gemini --version`.

## MySQL MCP Server (Data Plane: Connecting and Querying)

This section covers connecting to a MySQL database instance.

1. **Verify Environment Variables**: The extension requires the following environment variables to be set before the Gemini CLI is started:

    * `MYSQL_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of the MySQL server.
    * `MYSQL_PORT`: The port number of the MySQL server.
    * `MYSQL_DATABASE`: The name of the database to connect to.
    * `MYSQL_USER`: The username for authentication.
    * `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: The password for authentication.

2. **Handle Missing Variables**: If a command fails with an error message containing a placeholder like `${MYSQL_HOST}`, it signifies a missing environment variable. Inform the user which variable is missing and instruct them to set it.

3. **Handle Permission Errors**: If an operation fails due to permission, it is likely that the user does not have the correct privileges on the MySQL database. Database-level permissions (e.g., SELECT, INSERT) are required to execute queries.
